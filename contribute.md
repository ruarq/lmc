# Contribute
For things that have do be done, look into the issues section. If no issues exist,
feel free to contact me, I will reply with things that have to be worked on or implemented.
Before creating a pull request, run the `./prepare_commit.sh` script and check that
- your code compiles
- your changes work
- no warnings are generated
- clang-format formatted everything correctly
	- if this didn't happen, run the `./format.sh` script until everything is formatted correctly
- all test cases run successfully

Please stick to what I've written here, else your work might be rejected.

Also note that just sticking to the rules will not automatically mean your pull request
will be accepted. I might reject it either way.
